- Cost: $60,000-75,000

**Four Impossible Barriers:**
1. ❌ **Expert Recruitment:** Cannot find 20-25 Federal Register specialists on demand
2. ❌ **Time Delay:** 1 month setup = Information already obsolete
3. ❌ **Quality Inconsistency:** Human fatigue across 5,755 documents
4. ❌ **Sustainability:** Annual cost $3M-$3.75M for weekly updates

---

### Trinity Solution
**Per Execution:**
- Automated (built-in Federal Register interpretation)
- 7 hours from start to finish
- Cost: $18.42 (Gemini $15.83 + Search $2.59)

**Four Advantages:**
1. ✅ **Zero Recruitment:** Instant execution
2. ✅ **Real-Time:** Results same day as policy announcement
3. ✅ **Consistent Quality:** AI maintains standards across all documents
4. ✅ **Sustainable:** $2,600/year for weekly updates

---

### ROI Summary
**Single Execution:** 3,257x cost reduction | 99% time reduction  
**Annual (52 weeks):** Save $2.997M-$3.747M | ROI: 1,200x-1,500x

   - Adding Blacklist → Missing Future Policies
   - Unpredictable New Combinations

3. **Consistency Limitations**
   - Google API Distributed Data Centers
   - Differences by AI Model Version
   - Search Result Variability

### Response Strategy

✅ **Impurity Display Method**

- Provide URL + Snippet
- Manual Verification Required

✅ **Goal Change**
- 100% Purity (X) → Maximum Collection + Transparent Distinction (O)
- Complete Removal (X) → Clear Display (O)
- AI Alone (X) → AI + Human Collaboration (O)
