## Key Insights

### 1. How a Non-Developer Completed Python Code
"Week 1-26 Prompt Experience → Week 27-28 Python Requirements"
- Token Limit Experience → Auto-Save Request
- Interruption Issue Experience → Resume Function Request
- Turning Concerns into Code

### 2. Why Perfect Filtering is Impossible
"Federal Register Structural Limitations"
- Semiconductors + Pesticides + Pharmaceuticals Combined Documents
- Trade-off: Precision ↑ = Recall ↓
- Solution: ⚠️ Blacklist Warning Display

### 3. Debunking AI Bubble Theory
"$18.42 Completing $60,000-75,000 Work"
- Traditional Method: 20-25 Senior Experts × 1 Week
- AI: 7 Hours

### 4. The Trinity = Next-Generation Work Standard
"Claude (Planning) + Gemini (Execution) + Python (Control)"
- Achievable by Non-Developers
- Expandable to 8 Industries
- Based on Government Public Data

### 5. AI Limitations and Possibilities
"AI is a Tool, Final Judgment is Human"
- Pursuing Perfection (X) → Ensuring Transparency (O)
- Verifiable with 125,332 Lines of Logs
- AI + Human Collaboration

## System Architecture

### Data Flow

```
[Search Phase]
Custom Search API (959 searches)
  ↓
5,755 documents collected (Title + URL + Snippet)

[Filtering Phase]
Gemini API (analyze 30 at a time)
  ├─ Is it a future implementation policy?
  ├─ Is the date after the reference date?
  └─ Is it semiconductor-related?
  
Python Cross-Verification
  ├─ Check semiconductor keywords
  └─ Remove non-tariff keywords

[Result Phase]
245 policies selected
  ├─ Economic: 59
  ├─ HTS: 24
  ├─ Product: 32
  ├─ Strategy: 60
  ├─ Tariff Rate: 59
  └─ Timeline: 11

## Limitations and Disclaimer

### Why Perfect Filtering is Impossible

1. **Federal Register Document Structure**
   - Multiple Industries Announced in Single Documents
   - Semiconductors + Pesticides + Pharmaceuticals Combined Documents
   - Partial Extraction Impossible

2. **Trade-off Problem**
   - Precision ↑ → Recall ↓
   - Adding Blacklist → Missing Future Policies
   - Unpredictable New Combinations

3. **Consistency Limitations**
   - Google API Distributed Data Centers
   - Differences by AI Model Version
   - Search Result Variability

### Response Strategy

✅ **Impurity Display Method**
- Display "⚠️ Blacklist Warning"
- Provide URL + Snippet
- Manual Verification Required

✅ **Goal Change**
- 100% Purity (X) → Maximum Collection + Transparent Distinction (O)
- Complete Removal (X) → Clear Display (O)
- AI Alone (X) → AI + Human Collaboration (O)
